PROGRAMS AND PARTS

The Program Graphics System comes with several "template" programs that can be used as references. These can be found in the programs/ sub-folder.

The template programs are .JSON files that describe all of the "parts" used in that particular program.

Here is an example of a simple program called wakeup.json:

===
{
  "bug":"",
  "title":"Wake Up!",
  "subtitle":"Morning Panel Discussion",
  "chairman1":"Thom Thomson",
  "chairman2":"John Johnson",
  "parts":{
    "0":{
      "name":"Rosa Rosario",
      "title":"Horticulturist"
    },
    "1":{
      "name":"Eric Ericsson",
      "title":"Mobile Analyst"
    },
    "2":{
      "name":"Portia Gofast",
      "title":"Professional Driver"
    },
    "3":{
      "name":"Abel Bodiedman",
      "title":"Personal Trainer"
    }
  }
}
===

You can edit any of these files with any text editor (as long as you honor JSON formatting rules).

PROGRAM.JSON

The Program Graphics will save modifications to the program.json file. If no program is specified it will load this file by default.
